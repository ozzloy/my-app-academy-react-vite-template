# my react vite template

this template is a minimal bare bones app that just displays static
content, so doesn't need react at all.

## clone this with:
```
git clone https://github.com/ozzloy/my-app-academy-react-vite-template
```

or if you want to use tiged
```sh
npx tiged ozzloy/my-react-vite-template#main <new-project-name>
```

## run
```sh
cd $new_project_name
npm install
npm run dev
```

## make it your own
change the `title` in __index.html__, and `name` in __package.json__.
